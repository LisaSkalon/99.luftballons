# Identifying differentially expressed transposons across four life-cycle stages of Fasciola hepatica
## Introduction
Transposable elements (TEs) are highly repetitive mobile sequences, which play diverse roles in genome regulation. As well, it`s expected that TEs participate in lncRNAs function. In trematodes, lncRNA might be involved in development processes and life cycle regulation. 

## Mission
Our study is devoted to detecting transposons in transcriptomes of four different life-cycle stages of F.hepatica and analyzing their differential expression across stages.

## Goals
1. Mapping of RNA-seq data onto a list of transposons sequences and analyzing of TE expression
2. Assembly RNA-Seq data with a reference genome
3. 


Here we explore the contribution of transposable elements (TEs) to the makeup and regulation of lncRNAs in human,

the aim of capturing novel lncRNAs mapped to the genomes2
